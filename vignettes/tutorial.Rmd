```{r setup}
library(STAT302package)
# extract the data
demonstration_data <- my_gapminder$lifeExp

# p_value cut-off of alpha
alpha = 0.05

# Demonstrate a test of the hypothesis (Two-Sided)
result_ts <- my_t.test(demonstration_data, "two.sides", 60)
result_ts$p_val 

# Demonstrate a test of the hypothesis (less)
result_less <- my_t.test(demonstration_data, "less", 60)
result_less$p_val

# Demonstrate a test of the hypothesis (greater)
result_greater <- my_t.test(demonstration_data, "greater", 60)
result_greater$p_val
```
Interpretation: In the majority of analyses, an alpha of 0.05 is used as the cutoff for significance. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that thereâ€™s no difference between the means and conclude that a significant difference does exist.
